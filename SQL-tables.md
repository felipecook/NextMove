My SQL tables will be based on the high scores that the user will submit. This includes several columns that will display the score, the date, the players name and the time of the previous scores. I believe i will only require this one table because other than high scores the user will not have any other data that will be required to be displayed. If I think of any other tables I will add them to this document.
