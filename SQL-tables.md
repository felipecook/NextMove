My SQL tables will be based on the high scores that the user will submit. This includes several columns that will display the score, the date, the players name and the time of the previous scores. I believe i will only require this one table because other than high scores the user will not have any other data that will be required to be displayed. The user's score will be based on the number of moves that the user takes to solve the Knight's problem or in the case of the n-Queen's problem, the number of queens that the player can place on the board. If I think of any other tables I will add them to this document.
