Avid chess player:: This player is looking to use my application in order to challenge their mathematical reasoning. There will be three different problems on the application using a chess board and certain variations of chess pieces. 

The Avid Chess Player will open the application, enter their personal information (name) which will enable them to see previous high scores (a score based on the time they used to solve the problem). This high score count will enable the Avid Chess Player to continually see improvement in the game. 

Upon completion of the game, the Avid Chess Player will hopefully continue finding additional mathematical chess problems to solve outside of this application.
